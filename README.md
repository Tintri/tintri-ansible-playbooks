Tintri Ansible playbooks.

There is a library of Python scripts that interfaces Ansible to [Tintri's Python SDK](https://github.com/Tintri/tintri-python-sdk). The roles directory contains various roles that administrators managing
Tintri servers might find useful.

## Roles ##
Currently there is only one role, out of the box VMstore configuration.
